	Sorry, but your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag. Which means you are either not enough of a nerd for us or you "too much nerd", stop trying to be something you are not, stop using some non-mainstream stuff you hipster. Too solve this go to browsehappy and choose a browser that suits your style.
